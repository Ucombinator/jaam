- Rearrange children to remove edge crossings: 3
- Write README: 3
- Selection rectangle should be transparent: 3
- Add ID’s for all nodes: 3

Investigated, but probably won’t happen:
- Check parser for subspace.out (Skip because we want to change to using messages anyway)
- Change mouse cursor to hourglass while loading graph (seems really hard, a progress bar might be easier)
